  "MetaDescription": "Comprehensive guide to the RAL color system: history, numbering logic, Classic vs Design System Plus vs Effect collections, popular colors, and how to choose the right RAL color.",
  "BreadcrumbColors": "RAL Colors",
  "BreadcrumbGuide": "RAL Color Guide",
  "SchemaAbout": "RAL color system",

  "Intro": "Everything you need to know about the RAL color standard — from its origins in 1920s Germany to practical tips for choosing the right shade today.",

  "SectionHistoryTitle": "History of the RAL color system",
  "SectionHistoryBody1": "The RAL color system was created in 1927 by the \"Reichs-Ausschuß für Lieferbedingungen\" (Imperial Committee for Delivery Terms), a German standards body. Its original purpose was simple: manufacturers, suppliers, and buyers needed a shared language for color. Before RAL, ordering \"red paint\" could result in wildly different shades depending on the supplier.",
  "SectionHistoryBody2": "The first RAL color table contained just 40 colors. Over the decades, the collection grew as industries demanded more precise specification. In 1961, the four-digit numbering system still used in RAL Classic today was introduced. The RAL Design System followed in 1993, built on the CIELab color space for systematic color selection, and RAL Effect launched in 2007 to cover modern coating effects including metallics.",
  "SectionHistoryBody3": "Today, the system is maintained by RAL gGmbH, a subsidiary of the RAL Institute based in Bonn, Germany. RAL colors are recognized worldwide and referenced in building codes, industrial standards, and design specifications across Europe and beyond.",

  "SectionNumberingTitle": "How RAL numbering works",
  "SectionNumberingIntro": "Each RAL collection uses a different numbering scheme. Understanding the logic behind the numbers helps you navigate the catalog faster.",
  "NumberingClassicTitle": "RAL Classic (4-digit code)",
  "NumberingClassicBody": "The first digit indicates the color family. The remaining digits identify the specific shade within that family. For example, RAL 3020 (Traffic red) belongs to the red family (3xxx).",
  "NumberingClassicFamily1": "1xxx — Yellows",
  "NumberingClassicFamily2": "2xxx — Oranges",
  "NumberingClassicFamily3": "3xxx — Reds",
  "NumberingClassicFamily4": "4xxx — Violets",
  "NumberingClassicFamily5": "5xxx — Blues",
  "NumberingClassicFamily6": "6xxx — Greens",
  "NumberingClassicFamily7": "7xxx — Greys",
  "NumberingClassicFamily8": "8xxx — Browns",
  "NumberingClassicFamily9": "9xxx — Whites and Blacks",
  "NumberingDesignTitle": "RAL Design System Plus (H L C)",
  "NumberingDesignBody": "Colors are identified by three values: Hue (H), Lightness (L), and Chroma (C), derived from the CIELab color space. This makes it possible to find neighboring shades by adjusting one parameter at a time — for example, keeping hue and chroma constant while stepping through lightness levels.",
  "NumberingEffectTitle": "RAL Effect (4-digit + suffix)",
  "NumberingEffectBody": "Solid colors use a plain four-digit code (e.g., RAL 110-1). Metallic colors add an \"M\" suffix (e.g., RAL 110-M). The numbering reflects the order within the system rather than color family.",

  "SectionCollectionsTitle": "RAL collections compared",
  "SectionCollectionsIntro": "RAL maintains three official collections, each designed for different needs. Here is how they compare.",
  "CollectionClassicTitle": "RAL Classic",
  "CollectionClassicCount": "216 colors",
  "CollectionClassicBody": "The original and most widely used RAL collection. These are the colors you will find referenced in building specifications, safety standards, and product catalogs. If someone says \"RAL color\" without further context, they almost always mean Classic. The palette is curated rather than systematic — colors were added over decades based on industry demand.",
  "CollectionDesignPlusTitle": "RAL Design System Plus",
  "CollectionDesignPlusCount": "1,825 colors",
  "CollectionDesignPlusBody": "Built on the CIELab color space, this collection arranges colors systematically by hue, lightness, and chroma. It is the tool of choice for architects, interior designers, and color consultants who need to explore fine gradations and create harmonious palettes. The even spacing of colors makes it easy to find intermediate shades.",
  "CollectionEffectTitle": "RAL Effect",
  "CollectionEffectCount": "490 colors",
  "CollectionEffectBody": "Introduced in 2007, this collection includes 420 solid colors and 70 metallic colors specifically developed for modern coating technologies. The metallic shades cannot be accurately represented on screen — physical fan decks are essential for specifying Effect colors.",

  "SectionChoosingTitle": "How to choose the right RAL color",
  "SectionChoosingIntro": "Choosing a RAL color involves more than picking a shade you like on screen. Consider these factors for a reliable result.",
  "ChoosingStep1Title": "Define the application",
  "ChoosingStep1Body": "Indoor or outdoor? Walls, metal, wood, or plastic? The surface material and environment affect how a color looks and performs. Exterior coatings must withstand UV and weather, which may limit available finishes.",
  "ChoosingStep2Title": "Consider lighting",
  "ChoosingStep2Body": "Colors shift dramatically under different light sources. A warm white that looks inviting under incandescent light may appear yellowish under cool LED panels. Always evaluate colors under the lighting conditions where they will be seen.",
  "ChoosingStep3Title": "Account for surface finish",
  "ChoosingStep3Body": "Matte, satin, and high-gloss finishes of the same RAL color can look noticeably different. Gloss finishes reflect more light and appear brighter; matte finishes absorb light and appear deeper.",
  "ChoosingStep4Title": "Narrow by collection and family",
  "ChoosingStep4Body": "Start with the right collection (Classic for standard specs, Design System Plus for fine gradations, Effect for metallics). Then filter by color family to reduce the options to a manageable shortlist.",
  "ChoosingStep5Title": "Compare close matches",
  "ChoosingStep5Body": "Once you have a shortlist, compare similar shades side by side. Our comparison tool lets you see two RAL colors together. Small differences in hue or lightness become obvious only when colors are next to each other.",
  "ChoosingStep6Title": "Verify with a physical sample",
  "ChoosingStep6Body": "Screen colors are approximations. Before committing to a color for production or a building project, always confirm your choice with a physical RAL fan deck or spray-out sample under the intended lighting.",

  "SectionPopularTitle": "Popular RAL colors",
  "SectionPopularIntro": "Some RAL Classic colors appear far more often than others in specifications and projects. Here are some of the most commonly used.",
  "PopularWhitesTitle": "Whites",
  "PopularNeutralsTitle": "Neutrals",
  "PopularAccentsTitle": "Accents",

  "SectionUseCasesTitle": "Where RAL colors are used",
  "SectionUseCasesIntro": "RAL is the default color standard across a wide range of industries, particularly in Europe.",
  "UseCaseArchitectureTitle": "Architecture and construction",
  "UseCaseArchitectureBody": "Facade cladding, window frames, roofing, shutters, and structural steel are routinely specified in RAL. Colors like RAL 7016 (Anthracite grey) and RAL 9010 (Pure white) dominate modern building design.",
  "UseCaseInteriorsTitle": "Interior design and furniture",
  "UseCaseInteriorsBody": "Kitchen cabinets, office furniture, shelving systems, and wall paints frequently reference RAL for consistent color across different manufacturers and materials.",
  "UseCaseProductTitle": "Product and industrial design",
  "UseCaseProductBody": "Consumer electronics housings, appliance panels, and industrial machinery are often color-matched using RAL to ensure brand consistency across production runs.",
  "UseCaseInfrastructureTitle": "Infrastructure and public works",
  "UseCaseInfrastructureBody": "Traffic signs, guardrails, street furniture, pipelines, and utility enclosures follow RAL specifications. Safety colors like RAL 3020 (Traffic red) and RAL 1023 (Traffic yellow) are codified in European safety standards.",
  "UseCaseVehiclesTitle": "Vehicles and transportation",
  "UseCaseVehiclesBody": "Railway vehicles, commercial fleets, agricultural machinery, and military equipment use RAL colors for standardized liveries and corrosion-protection coatings.",

  "SectionComparisonTitle": "RAL vs other color systems",
  "SectionComparisonIntro": "RAL is one of several color standards in use worldwide. Each system serves different industries and use cases.",
  "ComparisonPantoneTitle": "RAL vs Pantone (PMS)",
  "ComparisonPantoneBody": "Pantone is the standard for print and graphic design, while RAL dominates industrial coatings and architecture. Pantone offers thousands of spot colors for ink on paper; RAL defines colors for paint, powder coating, and plastics. There is no official cross-reference — approximate matches can be found, but exact conversion is not possible.",
  "ComparisonNcsTitle": "RAL vs NCS (Natural Color System)",
  "ComparisonNcsBody": "NCS is based on human color perception and is popular in Scandinavia and parts of Europe. It describes any conceivable color using hue, blackness, and chromaticness. RAL uses fixed curated palettes. NCS is better for specifying custom shades; RAL is better when you need a specific, reproducible standard color.",
  "ComparisonDigitalTitle": "RAL vs HEX / RGB",
  "ComparisonDigitalBody": "HEX and RGB are digital color models for screens. They describe how a monitor emits light, not how a surface reflects it. Converting RAL to HEX gives an approximation that looks similar on a calibrated screen but will never be an exact match to the physical color.",

  "SectionDigitalTitle": "Digital colors vs physical colors",
  "SectionDigitalIntro": "An important caveat when browsing RAL colors online.",
  "SectionDigitalBody1": "Every RAL color shown on this site — or any website — is an approximation. Screens emit light using RGB subpixels, while physical surfaces reflect light. This fundamental difference means a HEX value can only simulate what a paint chip looks like, not reproduce it.",
  "SectionDigitalBody2": "Several factors affect accuracy: your monitor's color gamut and calibration, ambient lighting in your room, and the browser's color management. Two people looking at the same webpage may perceive the color differently depending on their hardware.",
  "SectionDigitalBody3": "For any project where color accuracy matters — architecture, product design, signage — always make your final decision using a physical RAL fan deck or sample panel. Digital tools like ours are excellent for narrowing options and comparing shades, but the last step should always be a real-world check.",

  "SectionToolsTitle": "Tools for working with RAL colors",
  "SectionToolsIntro": "Use these free tools to convert, compare, and explore the full RAL catalog.",
  "ToolConverterTitle": "Color converter",
  "ToolConverterDesc": "Convert any RAL color to HEX, RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other formats. Useful when you need digital values for design software or web development.",
  "ToolCompareTitle": "Color comparison",
  "ToolCompareDesc": "Place two RAL colors side by side to evaluate contrast, similarity, and suitability. Helps when choosing between close alternatives.",
  "ToolPickerTitle": "Color picker",
  "ToolPickerDesc": "Browse and search the complete RAL catalog with visual previews. Filter by collection, color family, or search by number and name.",

  "SectionFaqTitle": "Frequently asked questions",
  "Faq1Q": "Are RAL colors free to use?",
  "Faq1A": "The RAL color numbers and names are widely used in industry and can be referenced freely in specifications. However, the physical color samples, fan decks, and digital color data files are commercial products sold by RAL gGmbH.",
  "Faq2Q": "Can RAL colors be mixed?",
  "Faq2A": "Professional paint suppliers can mix most RAL colors to order. However, the RAL system itself defines fixed colors — there is no official formula for mixing two RAL colors to produce a third. For custom shades, the RAL Design System Plus offers the finest gradations.",
  "Faq3Q": "How accurate are RAL colors on screen?",
  "Faq3A": "Screen representations are approximate. The HEX and RGB values shown online are close but not exact matches. Monitor calibration, ambient light, and screen technology all affect how you perceive the color. For accurate color matching, always use physical RAL samples.",
  "Faq4Q": "What is the difference between RAL Classic and RAL Design?",
  "Faq4A": "RAL Classic contains 216 curated industry-standard colors identified by 4-digit codes. RAL Design System Plus contains 1,825 colors arranged systematically by hue, lightness, and chroma (CIELab color space). Classic is used for standard specifications; Design System Plus is used for professional color planning.",
  "Faq5Q": "How often are new RAL colors added?",
  "Faq5A": "New colors are added infrequently. RAL Classic has grown slowly over decades and currently contains 216 colors. RAL Design System Plus was significantly expanded in 2018 and now includes 1,825 colors. RAL gGmbH evaluates additions based on industry demand.",
