  "LearnMetrics": "Understanding Color Metrics",
  "LearnMetricsIntro": "Color can be measured in many different ways. Each metric captures a different aspect of how we perceive and work with color.",
  "LearnHue": "Hue",
  "LearnHueDesc": "Hue is the pure color position on the color wheel, measured in degrees from 0° to 360°. Red is at 0°, yellow at 60°, green at 120°, cyan at 180°, blue at 240°, and magenta at 300°. Hue tells you what 'family' a color belongs to, independent of how light, dark, or vivid it is.",
  "LearnSaturation": "Saturation",
  "LearnSaturationDesc": "Saturation measures how pure or vivid a color is, from 0% (completely gray) to 100% (fully saturated). Low saturation colors appear muted or washed out, while high saturation colors are bold and intense. Saturation is sometimes called 'chroma' or 'intensity'.",
  "LearnLrv": "Light Reflectance Value (LRV)",
  "LearnLrvDesc": "LRV measures how much light a surface reflects, from 0 (absorbs all light, pure black) to 100 (reflects all light, pure white). This is crucial for interior design and architecture - colors with LRV below 50 absorb more light than they reflect, making spaces feel smaller and requiring more artificial lighting.",
  "LearnTemperature": "Color Temperature",
  "LearnTemperatureDesc": "Color temperature, measured in Kelvin (K), describes whether a color feels warm (lower K, orange/red tones) or cool (higher K, blue tones). This concept comes from blackbody radiation - as metal heats up, it glows from red (≈2000K) through white (≈5500K) to blue (≈10000K). Warm colors create cozy, inviting atmospheres while cool colors feel calm and professional.",
  "LearnUndertone": "Undertone",
  "LearnUndertoneDesc": "Undertone is the subtle secondary hue that influences how a color appears and interacts with other colors. Even seemingly neutral colors often have warm (yellow, orange, red) or cool (blue, green, violet) undertones. Understanding undertones is essential for color coordination - colors with matching undertones tend to harmonize better together.",
