  "LearnMetrics": "Understanding Color Metrics",
  "LearnMetricsIntro": "Color can be measured in many different ways. Each metric captures a different aspect of how we perceive and work with color.",
  "LearnHue": "Hue",
  "LearnHueDesc": "Hue is the pure color position on the color wheel, measured in degrees from 0° to 360°. Red is at 0°, yellow at 60°, green at 120°, cyan at 180°, blue at 240°, and magenta at 300°. Hue tells you what 'family' a color belongs to, independent of how light, dark, or vivid it is.",
  "LearnSaturation": "Saturation",
  "LearnSaturationDesc": "Saturation measures how pure or vivid a color is, from 0% (completely gray) to 100% (fully saturated). Low saturation colors appear muted or washed out, while high saturation colors are bold and intense. Saturation is sometimes called 'chroma' or 'intensity'.",
  "LearnLightness": "Lightness (HSL)",
  "LearnLightnessDesc": "Lightness in the HSL color model represents how light or dark a color appears, from 0% (black) to 100% (white), with pure colors at 50%. Unlike brightness, lightness maintains color information - a 25% lightness red is a dark red, not just dim.",
  "LearnLrv": "Light Reflectance Value (LRV)",
  "LearnLrvDesc": "LRV measures how much light a surface reflects, from 0 (absorbs all light, pure black) to 100 (reflects all light, pure white). This is crucial for interior design and architecture - colors with LRV below 50 absorb more light than they reflect, making spaces feel smaller and requiring more artificial lighting.",
  "LearnCieL": "CIE L* (Lightness)",
  "LearnCieLDesc": "L* in the CIE Lab color space represents perceptual lightness from 0 (black) to 100 (white). Unlike simple lightness calculations, L* is designed to match human perception - equal numerical steps correspond to equal perceived differences in lightness.",
  "LearnCieA": "CIE a* (Green-Red Axis)",
  "LearnCieADesc": "The a* component in CIE Lab measures color position on the green-red axis. Negative values indicate green tones, positive values indicate red/magenta tones, and zero is neutral. This axis is useful for understanding a color's warm or cool undertones.",
  "LearnCieB": "CIE b* (Blue-Yellow Axis)",
  "LearnCieBDesc": "The b* component in CIE Lab measures color position on the blue-yellow axis. Negative values indicate blue tones, positive values indicate yellow tones, and zero is neutral. Combined with a*, this determines the overall hue in a perceptually uniform way.",
  "LearnTemperature": "Color Temperature",
  "LearnTemperatureDesc": "Color temperature, measured in Kelvin (K), describes whether a color feels warm (lower K, orange/red tones) or cool (higher K, blue tones). This concept comes from blackbody radiation - as metal heats up, it glows from red (≈2000K) through white (≈5500K) to blue (≈10000K). Warm colors create cozy, inviting atmospheres while cool colors feel calm and professional.",
