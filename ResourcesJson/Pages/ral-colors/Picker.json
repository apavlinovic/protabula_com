  "Title": "RAL Color Picker",
  "MetaDescription": "Identify RAL colors from any image. Upload a photo, click to sample colors, and find the closest matching RAL Classic and RAL Design colors with hex and RGB codes.",
  "Intro": "Upload an image and click anywhere to identify the closest matching RAL colors. Perfect for matching paint colors, design materials, or any color reference.",

  "LegendTitle": "Understanding Color Similarity",
  "LegendIntro": "The similarity between your sampled color and each RAL color is measured using Delta E (ΔE), a scientific metric for perceptual color difference. Lower values indicate closer matches.",
  "LegendLabel": "Label",
  "LegendDeltaE": "Delta E Range",
  "LegendMeaning": "What It Means",
  "LegendExactDesc": "Colors are virtually identical. The difference is imperceptible to the human eye.",
  "LegendVeryCloseDesc": "Extremely close match. Only trained colorists may notice a slight difference under ideal lighting.",
  "LegendCloseDesc": "Close match. A small difference may be noticeable when colors are placed side by side.",
  "LegendSimilarDesc": "Similar color family. The difference is clearly visible but the colors share the same general hue.",
  "LegendDifferentDesc": "Different colors. While in the same broad category, these colors are noticeably distinct.",

  "AlgorithmTitle": "How Color Matching Works",
  "AlgorithmIntro": "This tool uses industry-standard color science to find the closest RAL colors to any color you sample from an image. The matching process is designed to reflect how humans perceive color differences.",
  "AlgorithmStepsTitle": "The Matching Process",
  "AlgorithmStep1": "When you click on the image, we sample a 5×5 pixel region and calculate the average RGB color to reduce noise from individual pixels.",
  "AlgorithmStep2": "The RGB color is converted to the CIE L*a*b* color space, which is designed to be perceptually uniform—meaning equal distances in this space correspond to equal perceived differences.",
  "AlgorithmStep3": "We compare your sampled color against all 2,500+ RAL colors using the CIEDE2000 formula, calculating the perceptual difference (Delta E) for each.",
  "AlgorithmStep4": "The top 5 matches from RAL Classic and RAL Design System Plus are displayed, sorted by similarity.",
  "AlgorithmCIEDE2000Title": "Why CIEDE2000?",
  "AlgorithmCIEDE2000Desc": "CIEDE2000 is the latest and most accurate color difference formula developed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). Unlike simpler methods that just calculate RGB distance, CIEDE2000 accounts for how the human visual system perceives colors differently across the spectrum—we're more sensitive to certain hue shifts than others, and our perception varies with lightness and saturation.",
  "AlgorithmLabTitle": "The L*a*b* Color Space",
  "AlgorithmLabDesc": "The CIE L*a*b* color space separates color into three components: L* (lightness from black to white), a* (green to red), and b* (blue to yellow). This separation allows for more accurate color comparison than RGB, which is designed for displays rather than human perception."
